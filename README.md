## About the Project 

:chart: I investigated and analyzed the company's sales data, obtaining useful insights that would help the organization determine whether their strategy is effective.

:bar_chart: Found the most valuable ware and visualized the dynamics of sales.

:books: **Libraries used**: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## Objective

* Show the dynamics of the company's sales over three years.

![sales dynamics of each unit in 3 years](https://github.com/arina-korkhova/Company-Sales-Visualization/blob/main/plots/each_type_sales_dynamics_3years.png)

* Show the dynamics of the company's sales over the first year.

* Compare sales of facecream and facewash by month.

* Find share of sales of each type of product in the total number of products sold for the year.

* :soap: Sales of *bathingsoap* remained the highest throughout the entire period. 
* :tooth: The 2nd place in sales is occupied by *toothpaste*.
