# Company Sales Visualization

The Company Sales Data dataset contains information about the company's sales. 

Within this project, I am exploring the following:
* The dynamics of the company's sales over three years. 
* Compare sales of cream for facecream and facewash by month.
* The share of sales of each type of product in the total number of products sold for the year.
* The dynamics of sales (number of units and total profit) by quarters.

# Conclusions
* Sales drop every winter, although, in general, the profit increases every year.
* Sales of *bathingsoap* remained the highest throughout the entire period. 
* The 2nd place in sales is occupied by *toothpaste*.
* Sales and revenues are growing every quarter.
